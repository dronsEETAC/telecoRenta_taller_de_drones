#Taller-de-Drones     

##Workshop title: Taller de Drones    

In this workshop students will learn how to develop Python programs to control the operation of a drone. They will learn to create 
a program with a graphical interface that uses buttons to order the drone to take off or fly in a certain direction. 
The program will present the user with a map showing the position of the drone and allowing the drone to be guided with 
the poses of the body, using image recognition techniques.       

This repository provides a student guide with the required reference codes together with written and video materials 
to guide students during the process.        

The repository also contains a teacher guide with recommendation on how to use the workshop material in class but
also with additional materials to go much further and propose ambitious projects on topics such as image recognition 
using neural networks or web app development.     

##About

ICARUS at EETAC – UPC, in the frame of the TelecoRenta Proyect from the UNICO 5G Program.
