# Taller-de-Drones     

## Workshop title: Taller de Drones    

In this workshop, students will learn basic aspects of the operation of a drone from the user's point of view. To do this, they will use free access tools such as Mission Planner or the SITL simulator through which they will learn to perform typical operations such as taking off the drone, directing it to geolocated points, planning missions and even guiding a swarm of drones. Students will also learn how to develop simple Python applications to control drones.     
     
The [student guide](guiaEstudiante.pdf) offers a step-by-step itinerary, including small challenges. The [teacher's guide](guiaProfesor.pdf) provides additional resources and materials to pose more ambitious challenges, such as, for example, assembling a real drone or implementing neural networks for detecting objects from the drone.
